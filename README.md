### Hobbies
I make tools for data and organization. I like building websites for niche ideas and sharing them with others.

### Work
- I work at Earlham College as a Computational System Manager (2021 - present), creating HPC solutions for teaching and research, and helping students learn computational tools.
- Find the other half of my coding work on my [EC Gitlab profile](https://code.cs.earlham.edu/pelibby16).
