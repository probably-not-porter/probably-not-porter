# About Me
Hi, I'm Porter!
I mostly use this account for personal projects, but it's also where I keep track of projects made by others. 

If you are looking for my research work and other professional projects, you can find them on my [Earlham College Gitlab profile](https://code.cs.earlham.edu/pelibby16).

### Hobbies
I make tools for data and organization. I like building websites for niche ideas and sharing them with others.

### Work
- I work at Earlham College as a Computational System Manager (2021 - present), creating HPC solutions for teaching and research, and helping students learn computational tools.
- Co-leader of the Icelandic [Field Studies trip](https://fieldscience.cs.earlham.edu/)
